    <p>This is a graph of Annual Household Income in the United States over time from 1990 to 2021.</p>
    <p>However, besides income, an important issue to track is average consumer expenditure. The difference shows how much the average person has leftover.</p>
    <p>The size of each circle is determined by that difference of income - expenditure.</p>
    <p>Finally to see the data through another dimension, we use the color red and blue to indicate whether the difference of income - expenditure is greater than or less than the mean value over the years.</p>
